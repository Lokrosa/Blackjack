Dependencies
-----------------------------------------
Python 3+ (Current running version for me is 3.7)
	-May experience errors running in Py version 2 environment.

Pygame 1.9.2
	-Installation Guide: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

PIP (already included on newer Python installations, older version need to have pip installed manually)

In order to run the game you need to download and install Pygame 1.9.2, which handles the graphics, animation, and sound. Using PIP is the easiest way to import the library of modules, however link below will take you to the download repository for Pygame. https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads/

How to run
-----------------------------------------
Run the main.py file in order to start the game. This game supports relative path files and should run independently of OS.

NOTE: this game was written in the newest version of Python and requires Python 3+ with Pygame installed. Installation link given above for Pygame.
